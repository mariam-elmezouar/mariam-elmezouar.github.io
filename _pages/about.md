I am an Assistant Professor and Chair of the Computer Science Program at the Royal Military College of Canada (<a href="https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en/mathematics-and-computer-science/dr-mariam-el-mezouar">RMC</a>). My research lies at the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve software development processes.

I explore how AI and NLP techniques can process and understand human-generated text, whether structured or unstructured, such as chat conversations and technical documentation. My work involves fine-tuning large-scale models for domain-specific applications, developing machine learning approaches for natural language understanding, entity recognition, and information retrieval to enhance text processing and automated decision-making.

I also enjoy teaching and working with students, whether in the classroom or through research supervision.
